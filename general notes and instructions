Typescript is a superset of ES5 and ES6 which is built on top of javascript. It is created by microsoft and allows type information in javascript.

When defining a variable  in a function in Javascript, throws an error/exception if a non-matched typed variable is called. It can be avoided in typescript by declaring the type of the variable(in function).
JS: Example: 
function multiply(x,y){
return x*y;
}
multiply(2,3);
output: 2*3=6

But if a string is passed instead of numbers in the variables, throws undefined. and this exceptions is seen only when the application is run, which can be tricky at times.

to avoid this we use TS:
TS example.
function multiple(x:number, y:number){ //x:any, y:any will help in passing any value
return x*y;
}
multiply(2,3);

In this case, wen a string is passed, before running the application the IDE shows red underline which is an indication of exception which saves a lot of time.

let person:string; //defining
person =4; //shows red underline
person = 'bob';


-> to convert a typical typescript file to javascript file, use tsc command in the same project folder.
-> conversion of typescript file to javascript file is called Transpolation. TS---->JS.

To start an angular project: 
1. install node and type  
							npm install -g @angularcli // installs node js from command line along with required angular libraries from @angularcli.
2. to start a project:
							ng new ng2-cribs // ng2-cribs is the project name and this command helps in creating a new project with all necessary files imported from @angularcli
3. to run the project:
							ng serve

-> import @angular/forms                import @angular/http     are some of the individual packages which has various modules.

-> a component is something whih has specific functionalities like template,, view or its own styles.
